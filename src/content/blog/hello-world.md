This new blog is built with:
## Tech Stack

- **Astro** - Modern static site generator
- **Nix Flakes** - Reproducible development environment  
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting and deployment
- **Markdown** - Simple content authoring

### Why Astro?

Mostly because I've already tried Jekyll and Hugo before and wanted
to try something new. I like the *idea* of a more 'modern' dev
experience with native JS Framework support. Funny thing is, I hate
JS with a passion and *love* Go. However, I can't deny where JS
is today, and I'd also like to tweak the UI a lot, in which
a JS front-end framework would be helpful ~to make Claude
figure out because I hate front-end~ to learn..

### Why Nix?

I like reproducible environments. I am also a masochist.

### Why GitHub Pages?

It's free, duh.

### Why Markdown?

I think it's the  best for docs.
Also, I can keep everything in Obsidian, too. 

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share more content about:

- Nix: NixOS, nix-darwin, pain and suffering
- Infosec
- Personal projects
- This blog
